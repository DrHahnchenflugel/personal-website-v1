                The parts arrived! Time to test them...
                <br>
                I already had Quartus II 13.0 sp1 installed using Wine on my system, but it seemed to not detect my JTAG programmer module.
                After some research, I found out that the Wine install seemed to not be able to speak with my JTAG module, so I decided to install 
                the native Linux version. I settled on an upgrade up to Quartus 15.1, as it seemed to have better Linux support and support for both 
                the JTAG module v1 and v2, if needed. Basically, it was the Minecraft 1.7.10 of Quartus versions.
                <br>
                I first thought of keeping the Wine version, but the jtag daemon, which uses port 1309, could only run on one instance at a time, and the Wine version
                kept taking over the port whenever I ran the Wine version. So, I uninstalled the Wine version and started to install the native Linux version.
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quartus Prime Web Edition <a href="https://www.altera.com/downloads/fpga-development-tools/quartus-ii-web-edition-design-software-version-15-0-b145-linux">[Link]</a></li>
                    <li>Quartus Prime Lite (Offline Install) Edition <a href="https://www.altera.com/downloads/fpga-development-tools/quartus-prime-lite-edition-design-software-version-15-1-b185-linux">[Link]</a></li>
                </ul>
                I started by trying to install the <i>web edition</i> of Quartus 15.1 (see above), but the installer kept crashing around ~95% with a segmentation fault. 
                My first instinct was to look for an offline installer, which I found on the same website (see above). From the site, I went to the <i>individual files</i> section
                and downloaded the QuartusLiteSetup-15.1.0.185-linux.run file, alongside the files for the Cyclone IV device support <i>(cyclone-15.1.0.185.qdz)</i>. Following the website instructions,
                I placed the downloaded .run file in a temporary folder with the .qdz file, and made the files executable using 
                <br>
                <code>chmod +x *.run</code>.
                <br>
                Then, I ran the installer using
                <br>
                <code>sudo ./QuartusLiteSetup-15.1.0.185-linux.run</code>
                <br>
                and followed the installation instructions. It did bring up licensing, but that window is more of a suggestion than anything - just press "ok" 2 times and move on.
                All installed! Let's test the JTAG programmer...
