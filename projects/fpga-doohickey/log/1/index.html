                I've always wanted to make a fun little hardware toy that has a bunch of lights, 
                buttons, and maybe a small screen for kids to play with while waiting for class at Exceed Robotics. 
                "Doohickey" is very much the best way to describe such a device.
                <br>
                The other day, I was browsing AliExpress, as one does, and stumbled upon a bunch of 
                <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007724924065.html">LED-enabled buttons</a>, 
                which looked a lot like the buttons in the Death Star control room. So I felt inspired and remembered about the LED+button thingie I wanted to make
                - why not finally get around to it? Since I already had some FPGA experience from school, I thought now would be a great time to do a project 
                unrelated to my school work. I also wanted to get some experience in SystemVerilog, as it's more modern than VHDL, which is TMU's primary FPGA language.
                <br>
                So, i started looking for Quartus-based FPGA dev boards (as I was most used to Altera's tools), and found a few options on AliExpress.
                My requirements were as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Quartus-based FPGA board</li>
                    <li>Small</li>
                    <li>Enough I/O for the LEDs, buttons, and </li>
                    <li>I/O compatible an OLED board</li>
                    <li>JTAG connector for uploading code</li>
                </ul>
                After some time, I found a <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005010338389897.html">cheap AliExpress board</a> based on the 
                Altera Cyclone IV EP4CE6E22C8N FPGA, which had enough proper I/O pins and a JTAG connector. A few buttons and potentiometers later, and I had my parts list.
                <br>
                I also wanted to get an OLED display for some extra experience, which came with its own challenges: the FPGA board had logic levels of 3V3, 2V5 and 1V8, whereas
                most OLED modules I could find were based on a 5V level. After about 20 minutes of searching, I found a 3V3 OLED module on Amazon, which was also the last available
                one from the seller. Not believing my luck, I quickly ordered it, along with the rest of the parts.
                <br>
                Now, we wait for the parts to arrive...
