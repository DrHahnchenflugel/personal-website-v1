            A Cyclone IV FPGA-powered interactive hardware toy using buttons and potentiometers as inputs
              and an I2C OLED screen & LEDS as outputs - all coded in SystemVerilog.

      <!-- What -->
      <section>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>What is this?</h2>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>This project is a small, self-contained FPGA "toy" designed to be poked,
                  prodded, twisted, and experimented with.</strong></li>
              <br>
              Physical inputs (buttons, switches, knobs, sliders) directly control visible outputs: an OLED transforming
              a live waveform and a bunch of LEDs running patterns that also react to user input. There's no abstraction
              layer, no software UI, and no microcontroller doing the thinking - the FPGA is the system itself.
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Why -->
      <section>
        <div class="container">
            I wanted a physical FPGA project that wasn't a lab assignment, or a project for a project's sake.

            The goal is twofold. I wanted:
            <ul>
                <li>An FPGA project</li>
                <li>A toy that kids could play with while waiting for class</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout">
                <p>
                For younger students, it should be physically engaging - lights animate on their own, patterns shift,
                    and turning a knob or pushing a button obviously does something.
                </p>
                <p>
                For older students, it should be something they can actually learn from. THe controls are mapped to
                    real concepts: amplitude, frequency, signal inversion, function selection, and pattern generation.
                    Also, flashy lights.
                </p>
            </div>

            Under the hood, it's meant to demonstrate digital design ideas: synchronous logic, timing, statem machines,
            pseudo-random behavior, and simple waveform generation. It does all this without hiding everything behind a
            CPU or firmware layer.
